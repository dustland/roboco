## Overview

RoboCo is a powerful platform that combines Domain-Driven Design with Multi-Agent Systems to create intelligent, collaborative AI teams. Built with a clean architecture that separates concerns into domain, application, infrastructure, and interface layers, RoboCo enables you to build sophisticated AI applications with minimal boilerplate.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns and dependency injection
- **Multi-Agent Teams**: Specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems
- **Sprint Management**: Built-in project and sprint management for agile development
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for enhanced agent communication and reasoning
- **Extensible Tools**: Plug-and-play tools for research, analysis, and interaction
- **REST API**: Comprehensive API with FastAPI for seamless integration
- **Workspace Management**: Organized workspaces for artifacts and project resources

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dustland/roboco.git
cd roboco

# Setup environment
./setup.sh  # On Unix/macOS
# or
setup.bat   # On Windows

# Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start the API server
./start.sh  # Uses default host (127.0.0.1) and port (8000)
# Or with custom options
./start.sh --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --reload
```

## Documentation

- [Domain-Driven Design](docs/domain_driven_design.md) - Architecture overview
- [Config-Based Design](docs/config_based_design.md) - Team configuration
- [Object Model](docs/object_model.md) - Core domain models
- [MCP](docs/mcp.md) - Multi-agent collaboration protocol

## Configuration

RoboCo uses environment variables for configuration with sensible defaults:

```
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
WORKSPACE_DIR=~/roboco_workspace
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

The `start.sh` script provides a convenient way to launch the API server with various configuration options:

```bash
# Basic usage
./start.sh

# Available options
./start.sh --host=0.0.0.0     # Bind to all interfaces
./start.sh --port=8080        # Use custom port
./start.sh --reload           # Enable auto-reload for development
./start.sh --workers=4        # Use multiple worker processes
./start.sh --help             # Show all available options
```
